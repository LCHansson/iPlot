Description: iPlot is a data exploration tool that features a range of visual
    and numeric analytical tools in a minimalistic interface. Built mainly on
    shiny and ggplot2, iPlot is still in its early stages of development but is
    already usable for exploring data. Run iPlot from an R session with any
    data set or use the 'sliver' package (also in development) for a preloader
    GUI.
